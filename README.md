## Changelog

Changes for each release are documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/Emanuell-Dan/manchester-vuejs/releases).

## Issues

We don't have any guidelines around issue reporting. For the time being, we believe this decision will encourage visitors to report anything they deem to be a bug which can be addressed.

## Contributions

This guide has been written with minimal knowledge for best practices around OSS. The assumptions made follow the author experience as a developer up to this point in time.

Contributions, however small, are welcomed and encouraged. This is a live documentation and may change as the project progresses and its contributors become more experienced with open-source software development.

Please refer to the full guide [here](https://github.com/Emanuell-Dan/manchester-vuejs/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
