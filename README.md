## Project Board

For the time being, Trello will be our tool of choice. It is simple, fast and super easy to use. Moreover, I find its UI/UX as good on mobile as on desktop. It is visible to anyone with the link and will show up in search engines. **Only those invited to the team can add and edit the board.**
  * [Vue.js Manchester team](https://trello.com/vuejsmanchester "Vue.js Manchester team")
  * [Vue.js Manchester project board](https://trello.com/b/O5fmUjJB/project-board "Vue.js Manchester project board")

The board will have a detailed up-to-date plan of what is currently being developed, any bugs, as well as new features ready to be picked up by contributors.

We adhere to a label system to differentiate the type of work involved in completing each task:

  * **Green** - new feature
  * **Blue** - technical debt
  * **Red** - issue or bug
  * **Yellow** - documentation

## Contributions

Contributions to this **documentation file** are welcomed and encouraged. Multiple people may collaborate towards the completion of one task.

When picking a new card to work on, make sure you assign yourself to it. Before creating a new branch double check you are **basing it off master**. From there, depending on the task, create a new branch as follows:

  * **Feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/card-name`
  * **Bugfix branch**: `git checkout -b bugfix/card-name`
  * **Documentation branch**: `git checkout -b documentation/card-name`

Once the work has been completed please make sure that **linting** and **unit tests** are passing before raising a **pull request**. If you have any difficulties with either of the above please go ahead and raise a pull request anyway but mention this in the description such that other contributors may help. Moreover, if you are not satisfied with the quality of your code but have achieved the task, go ahead and raise a pull request. We will be discussing code improvements wherever possible.
