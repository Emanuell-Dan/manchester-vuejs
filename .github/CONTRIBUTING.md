# Manchester Vue.js Contributing Guide

## Project Board

We have chosen Trello as our project management tool. It is simple, fast and super easy to use. Moreover, I find its UI/UX as good on mobile as on desktop. It is publicly visible to anyone with the link and will show up in search engines. **To reduce clutter, only those invited to the team have access to create, add or remove tasks.**

  * [Vue.js Manchester project board](https://trello.com/b/O5fmUjJB/project-board "Vue.js Manchester project board")

The board is linked to our GitHub repo and all tasks should have associated branches/issues/pull requests to them. The labelling system should also be mimicking the one from GitHub.

Each card should automatically be updated when a change occurs in GitHub. Similarly, changes in GitHub should be reflected back to the cards in Trello.

The board will have a detailed up-to-date plan of what is currently being developed, issues raised, as well as a backlog of features ready to be picked up by contributors.

## Guidelines

Should you want to help, but are unsure where to start from, feel free to reach out to any of the active members who are involved in this project. In the past, some features have been developed while pairing physically and remotely. With that being said, multiple contributors may collaborate towards the completion of one task.

Most of the outstanding tasks already have branches associated with them and are ready to be picked up and worked on. It is advised to always rebase from master before you commence working on your branch.

Once the work has been completed, please make sure that **linting** and **unit tests** are passing before raising a **pull request**. Raise a PR regardless of whether you are satisfied with the quality of your solution, as long as the task has been achieved. We will be discussing code improvements wherever possible.
